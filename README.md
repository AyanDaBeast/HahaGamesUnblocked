# HahaGames Unblocked

A simple, lightweight HTML-based launcher that lets you access the Haha Games website in environments where the main domain may be blocked.

## 🚀 How It Works
This project uses a clean HTML embed to load Haha Games through a different path.  
No executables, no installers, no scripts — just a single HTML file you can open locally.

## 📦 Getting Started
1. Download the ZIP from GitHub.
2. Extract it.
3. Open `HahaGamesEmbed.html` in any browser.
4. Enjoy access to Haha Games.

## 🔒 Safety
- This project contains **no malware**, **no trackers**, and **no external scripts** beyond what HahaGames itself loads.
- All code is visible and easy to inspect.
- You can run it offline before loading the site to verify its behavior.
